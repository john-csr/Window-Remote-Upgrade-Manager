Author: John C.
Version: 1.0
Date: September 2025

Overview:
This suite enables IT administrators to remotely perform in-place Windows upgrades using a combination of PowerShell scripts and an HTA interface. It supports silent execution, progress monitoring, and file verification across multiple machines.

Components:
1. winupgrade.ps1 – Launches the upgrade remotely via scheduled task.
2. upgr-progressmon.ps1 – Monitors upgrade progress in real time.
3. HTA Interface – Provides GUI for launching scripts and managing upgrades.

Requirements:
- Administrator rights on all target machines.
- WinRM enabled and accessible.
- PowerShell execution policy set to allow script execution.
- Setup files staged in a network share.
- Scripts located in H:\Scripts. (adjust the PowerShell script paths as needed for your environment)

HTA Functions:
1. CopySetupFiles
   - Copies setup files from a network share to C:\WinSetup on the target machine.
   - Uses robocopy for reliable transfer.
   - Format for network share:
     (source) z:\source_files 
     (destination) computer name -ex. workstation1
    

2. VerifyFiles
   - Uses WMI to confirm that C:\WinSetup exists and contains files.
   - Displays file count in output box.
   - Does not count files in subfolders.

3. LaunchUpgrade
   - Executes winupgrade.ps1 with the specified computer name.
   - Starts a scheduled task remotely to run setup.exe silently.
   - Format for computer name:
     a0751L314-5739 (no slashes, spaces, or domain suffixes)

4. LaunchMonitor
   - Executes upgr-progressmon.ps1 to track upgrade progress.
   - Displays live progress bar and status messages.
   - Keeps shell open using cmd.exe /k for visibility.

Usage Steps:
1. Enter the target computer name in the HTA textbox.
2. Click "Copy Setup Files" to transfer upgrade files.
3. Click "Verify Files" to confirm readiness.
4. Click "Launch Upgrade" to begin the upgrade process.
5. Click "Launch Monitor" to track progress in real time.

Notes:
- Scripts must reside in H:\Scripts (can be adjusted in the HTA code as needed).
- Setup files must be accessible via UNC path.
- HTA should be run from a technician’s workstation with network access to all targets.
- Monitor script shows progress stages such as "Rebooting into setup" and percentage completion.

Benefits:
- Centralized upgrade control.
- Silent execution with minimal user disruption.
- Real-time monitoring and feedback.
- Scalable across dozens or hundreds of machines.
